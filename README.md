The project is built using Java, and it uses various design patterns such as Command for undo-redo, reasoners, backtracker; Strategy or Template Method for reasoners; and Composite for compound commands as well as compound reasoners. Additionally, it utilizes the Model-View-Controller architecture and has a package ypa with package-info.java describing your YPA, package ypa.model with multiple cooperating ADT classes that define the model, package ypa.gui with your YPA GUI, package ypa.command with an Undo-Redo facility, package ypa.reasoning with automatic reasoners and package ypa.solvers with a backtracking solver.

To run the project, you will need to have Java installed on your machine and use an IDE to run the main class. The project also includes JUnit 5 test cases for core non-GUI classes, ypa.model, ypa.command, ypa.reasoning and ypa.solvers, to ensure the proper functioning of the Puzzle Assistant.

Overall, the goal of this project is to provide an interactive and user-friendly solution for solving and creating Killer sudoku puzzles. With its various features and design patterns, it aims to make the solving process more efficient and enjoyable.
