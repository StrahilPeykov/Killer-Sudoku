## Puzzle Description
Hidato is a logic puzzle where the goal is to fill a grid with consecutive numbers that connect horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In every Hidato puzzle, there are given numbers to help the player get started. The challenge is to fill the remaining cells with numbers that create a continuous sequence. It's a test of deductive reasoning and a fun way to develop logical thinking skills. More about Hidato can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidato).
